## Sample Question and Solution

Use `seq()` to create the vector $(1,2,3,\ldots,20)$.

```{r}
seq(1,20)
```

## Question 1 

The Titanic Passenger Survival DataSet provides information on the fate of passengers on the fatal maiden voyage of the ocean liner "Titanic." The dataset is available from the Department of Biostatistics at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine (http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/titanic3.csv)in several formats. store the Titanic DataSet `titanic_train` using the following commands. 
```{r}
library(titanic)
titanicDataset <- read.csv(file = "http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/titanic3.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)
summary(titanicDataset)
```

a) Extract the columns `sex`, `age`, `cabin` and `survived` into a new data frame of the name 'titanicSubset'.

```{r}
titanicSubset <- titanicDataset[, c("sex", "age", "cabin", "survived")] #Extraction of the four columns
head(titanicSubset) #Just to see what the dataframe subset looks like
```


b) Use the aggregate() function to display the total number of survivors grouped by `sex`

```{r}
x <- aggregate(survived ~ sex, data = titanicDataset, FUN = sum)
x
```

c) Use the count() function in `dplyr` package to display the total number of passengers within each Ticket Class `Pclass.`

```{r}
#install.packages("dplyr")
library("dplyr")
count(titanicDataset,pclass, name = "number of passengers")
```

d) Answer the following graphically:
1. What was the survival rates for females and males?
2. What was the age distribution on the Titanic?
```{r}
#1. Survival Rates
female <- which(titanicDataset$sex == "female" & titanicDataset$survived == 1)
male <- which(titanicDataset$sex == "male" & titanicDataset$survived == 1)
survivalrates <- c(length(female), length(male)) #Data for Barplot

barplot(survivalrates, names.arg = c("Female", "Male")) #Barplot

#2. Age Distribution 
hist(titanicDataset$age)
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
```

e)Use the `for` loop and `if` control statements to list the children's names, aged 14 or under, on the Titanic.
```{r}
for(i in 1:length(titanicDataset$age)) 
  {
  if(titanicDataset$age[i] <= 14 & !is.na(titanicDataset$age[i])) #is.na bc missing values
    {
    print(titanicDataset$name[i]) #print the names of the children aged 14 or less
    }
}
```

## Question 2

In an experiment of rolling 10 dice simultaneously. Use the binomial distribution to calculate the followings:

a) The probability of getting six 6's
```{r}
dbinom(6,10,prob=(1/6))
```

b) The probability of getting six, seven, or eight 3's
```{r}
sum(dbinom(c(6, 7, 8), 10, prob = (1/6)))
```

c) The probability of getting six even numbers
```{r}
dbinom(6, 10, prob = 0.5)
```

\newpage
## Question 3 

In a shipment of 20 engines, history shows that the probability of any one engine proving unsatisfactory is 0.1

a) Use the Binomial approximation to calculate the probability that at least three engines are defective? 
```{r}
1 - pbinom(2, size = 20, prob = 0.1)
```


b) Use the Poisson approximation to calculate the probability that at least three engines are defective? 
```{r}
1 - ppois(2, lambda = 2) #where 2 is from 0.1 * 20 engines
#2 because ppois will calculate 2 or less (inclusive)
```


c) Compare the results of parts a and b, then illustrate graphically on how well the Poisson probability distribution approximates the Binomial probability distribution.
```{r}
#install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
#In terms of results, with the Poisson distribution we have a slightly higher chance of 3+ #engines that are defective. The binomial distribution is a better choice here as a given #time is not #provided as would be common with a Poisson prob. dist. and we are given a #certain # of trials (in this case the shipment of 20 engines).

par(mfrow = c(1,2))
binomData <- data.frame(EngineFailures = rbinom(n = 10000, size = 20, prob = 0.1))
ggplot(binomData, aes(x = EngineFailures)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) + ggtitle("Binom")

poisData <- data.frame(EngineFailures = rpois(n = 10000, lambda = 2))
ggplot(poisData, aes(x = EngineFailures)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=1) + ggtitle("Poisson")
```

## Question 4 

Write a script in R to compute the following probabilities of a normal random variable with mean 16 and variance 9

a) lies between 14.4 and 20.3 (inclusive)
```{r}
pnorm(20.3, 16, sd = 3) - pnorm(14.4, 16, sd = 3)
```


b) is greater than 21.8
```{r}
1 - pnorm(21.8, 16, sd = 3)
```


c) is less or equal to 10.5
```{r}
pnorm(10.5, 16, sd = 3)
```


d) is less than 13 or greater than 19
```{r}
pnorm(13, 16, sd = 3) + (1 - pnorm(19, 16, sd = 3))
```
